* Need to load data sets for tests.  This requires:
 - bundles, linking content to policies
 - policy reader for policies
 - ontological description for policy language

Don't couple the XML reader; need to define interface so we can use different license representations.

Need to be able to use different ontologies for licenses.  Plan for this; use 'ontological description' design for this.

This is really more about defining a *repository* for these bundles; a directory to start with? load it with bundles, which reference a content file and an XML license file? create an OD that the license file can be converted to?
